# duous server
``Provide a Minecraft Server software for protocol version 5 (1.7.10) and a flexible Lua plugin system.``

## Future goals
---
### Near
---
``Clone the vanilla server completely.``

- This is difficult because there is little documentation on the inner workings of the vanilla server.
### Far
---
``Implement a proxy system to allow users to jump between servers, like BungeeCord.``
